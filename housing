## Housing

### Neighborhood recommendations 

Most interns end up living in Foggy Bottom or DuPont circle. However, any area that connects to the silver/blue/orange line will get you to the bank easily (closest stop: Farragut West). 

### Where to look for housing

The World Bank has their own internal housing platform, but you need access to your bank email to access it. If that is not an option for you, or you just want to find housing another way,
here are some alternatives: 

1. Facebook groups for GWU or GU students. Often, students will sublease their apartments for the summer. Subleasing is usually cheaper than short-term rent. 
2. GWU summer housing. GWU (located in Foggy Bottom) has summer housing options. https://summerhousing.gwu.edu/
3. Georgetown housing. The neighboorhood is lively with lots of restaurants, but it is farther from the Bank. https://residentialliving.georgetown.edu/summer/individual/
4. Whatsapp groups. There are usually whatsapp groups of people looking for housing, but they change each year. 
5. Sabbatical Homes. This is a housing platform (more curated) for people in academia. https://www.sabbaticalhomes.com/
