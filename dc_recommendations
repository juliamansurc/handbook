4. Friday movie nights at the Kennedy Center - completely free. Make sure to bring a blanket or towel to sit on.

### Bookstores
1. Bridge Street Books in Georgetown – Tiny bookstore but with one of the best poetry and philosophy sections I’ve ever seen. There’s a smart man who sometimes works there, and you’ll feel
like buying something intellectual just to earn his approval
2. Lost City Books in Adams Morgan – One of the most unique bookstores in the city. They sell both new and used books, host tons of events and book clubs, and have an excellent poetry
and international literature section
3. Middle East Books in Dupont Circle – A whole bookstore just about the Middle East. Countries and topics that barely get a shelf elsewhere fill entire sections here. They also
sell delicious olive oils and home goods
4. Politics and Prose in Van Ness – The name says it all – one of DC’s best nonfiction bookstores, especially for politics, history, and sociology. Lots of good events too
5. Capitol Hill Books – A completely chaotic and much-beloved secondhand bookstore
