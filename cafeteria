## How to navigate  the cafeteria (what to expect)

### Hours 

The cafeteria is open both for breakfast and lunch. For lunch, most interns go in between 11:30 AM and 2:00 PM. A quick caveat is that, between 12:15 PM and 1:00 PM, the cafeteria is often full or has limited seating available.

### Food options

As of Summer 2025, the cafeteria offers the options:

1. Chefs table: 

2. Cocina:

3. Soup:

4. Noodle:

5. Mediterranean:

6. Spice Trade:

7. Grill:

All fo which have vegetarian options. There is also a salad bar and a desserts section. Water -- including sparkling water -- is free (located towards the end on the right).

### How to pay 

There are a few machines to pay. Depending on what you've gotten, you have to either select said option on the screen or place the food on the scale and click "food by weight". Then, select the container you chose and press submit. After, you can pay with a card on the machine. 

There is also an option to pay at the cashiers.
