## Gym

## What
There is a gym in the main WB building! It has decent equipment and doesn't get very full, especially in July, so it's a good deal in my opinion. 

## Where
1. MC Building (the main building), C3 floor (3 levels below ground). 
2. IFC Building

## Cost
$35, which includes access to both gyms, a sauna, and group classes such as yoga and pilates.
