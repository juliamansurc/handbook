The MC Building (the main building) has a very nice gym on the C3 floor (3 levels below ground). STCs and interns pay a monthly fee of $35 dollars to get access to it, 
which includes a sauna and group classes like yoga and pilates. It has decent equipment and doesn't get very full, especially in July, so it's a good deal in my opinion.
