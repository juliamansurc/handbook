Welcome, new interns! 

We know that starting a new position comes with lot of excitment/anxiety/uncertainty.

1. What to do on your first day in person (first-day)
2. How to navigate the cafeteria (cafeteria)
3. How to look for housing in DC (housing)
4. What to wear (dress_code)
5. What to do in DC (dc_recommendations)
6. How to use the gym (gym)
7. Overall recommendations (other_notes)


We hope it is helpful!
