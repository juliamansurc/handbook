Welcome, new interns! 

We know that starting a new position comes with lot of excitment/anxiety/uncertainty. Our hope is that this repository serves as a quick introduction to how it is to work at Development Impact (DIME). Here, we've gathered information on topics that might be useful for someone coming to DC. The content emcompasses:

1. What to do on your first day in person
2. How to navigate the cafeteria
3. How to look for housing in DC
4. Useful acronyms/terms used at the World Bank
5. xx

We hope it is helpful!
