## Before you start

1. Usually, you will only get your first internship-related email (other than signing the contract) the day before your start date.  
2. Make sure you are in contact with your manager for them to reserve you a desk in the building.
3. If you do not have a desk reserved, don't just go into another room. Ask your manager or go to the floor assistant. 

## Other tips

1. If you want to meet with someone, it is okay to just email them and schedule a coffee. Just introduce yourself and be prepared. 
2. Make sure to see what events are going on at the Bank. They are a great opportunity to learn more.
