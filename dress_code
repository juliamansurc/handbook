## Dress Code at DECDI
We've used this https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/starting-new-job/guide-to-business-attire as reference. 

In general, the World Bank is a formal environment (business formal/ business professional). However, DECDI is a little less formal (think between business professional and business casual).
From our perspective, this is what we've observed so far: 

1. It is okay to not wear heels and stick to flats/ loafers
2. People do not wear jeans or informal pants 
3. A shirt without a blazer is acceptable
4. We haven't seen anybody wear sneakers
5. Most people don't wear ties
