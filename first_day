## Instructions - First day 

### How to get your badge

To get into any World Bank building, the first thing you need to do is get your badge. To do so, you need to go to the 18th Street entrance of
the main World Bank building (we call it MC). When you get there, just go to where it says "visitors" and go through security. After that, you'll need your US ID or passport and your UPI (a number that should be on your onboarding email). 

### How to get into buildings 

Before getting into any building, you'll need to show your badge to security and then place your badge on the scanner (place it where there is 
a rectangle). If you're going into MC, you'll also need to show your badge after you go through the scanner. 

### Where to go on your first day (where DECDI is located)

DECDI is on the G Building (1776 G St NW, Washington, DC 20006), but your floor depends on who you're working with. Some interns also work at the library, which is located on the MC Building's bottom level. 

PS: To get into any floor, you'll also need to swipe your badge.
